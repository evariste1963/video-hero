<h2>Why attend a Wild Women event or retreat?</h2>

<p>
	“It was one of the best weeks of my life. To be amongst a group of women where all judgements are
	suspended is a truly powerful experience indeed. The experience & guidance from the facilitators
	was genuine, kind & so warm. Every woman needs to experience this.”<span>
