		<h1>
			We are so pleased to announce a new celebratory weekend
			<br />
			<span style="color:purple">The Wild Women Retreats ‘Summer Village’!</span>
		</h1>
		<p class="pre-amble">
			Despite this ‘sabbatical’ year; as Wild Women, we still feel an instinctive-need to come
			together to share sisterhood, community, and beauty. As human-animals, we all carry a
			biological expectation of welcome and connection. It’s inherent to our nature to want to
			exchange of ourselves; through laughter, food, creativity and ritual.
			<br /><br />
			With this in mind, the Wild Women Retreats ‘Summer Village’ is proudly born.
			<br /><br />
			Set in a beautiful, tranquil valley in West Dorset, close to the Jurassic Coast, Litton Cheney
			is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Rich in prehistory and singing with spirit, the valley
			is at it’s most beautiful in the early summer.
			<br /><br />
			We will gather on Friday evening for beautiful food and a ceremonial opening before we set the
			scene for our weekend of celebration and connection. Each morning there will be yoga with
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/yogaJmoran" target="”_blank”">Juli Moran</a>, and song,
			sharing, intentional art and craft, ritual, meditation, laughter and magic. On Saturday
			evening we hope to gather together on the beach for ceremony and swimming (if the Sun and Sea
			allow, and swimming optional!) as the sun sets over the water. We will say goodbye on Sunday
			afternoon.
			<br /><br />
			Expect a joyful coming-together, with a focus on tribe and celebration. For those of you we know
			well and those who haven’t come to us before, see below for booking and further details. We can’t
			wait to see you there!
			<br /><br />
			This event will form a part of our exciting new yearly calendar, which will launch in 2024. It’s
			also going to include a deep-dive 5 day retreat for those who want more intensive work, and a year-course
			as well as the usual Glastonbury Winter Gathering (this year, over the weekend of 2/3 December
			2023). We’ll keep you updated when all the specifics come through.
			<br /><br />
			Lastly, introducing our
			<a href="https://ko-fi.com/wildwomenretreats" target="”_blank”">Ko-fi</a>
			donations page! Without events, the funds to run our business are meagre and all the support we
			can get helps towards our administration and maintenance costs. We’d be very grateful for you to
			drop some pennies in or share this link around…
			<br /><br />
			Warmly, Natalie, Boann, and Rozi with Afric, Gemma, Juli & Shelley xxx
