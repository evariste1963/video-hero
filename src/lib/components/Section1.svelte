	<h1>
		We are so pleased to announce a new celebratory weekend
		<br />
		<span style="color:purple">The Wild Women Retreats ‘Summer Village’!</span>
	</h1>
	<p class="pre-amble">
		Despite this ‘sabbatical’ year; as Wild Women, we still feel an instinctive-need to come
		together to share sisterhood, community, and beauty. As human-animals, we all carry a biological
		expectation of welcome and connection. It’s inherent to our nature to want to exchange of
		ourselves; through laughter, food, creativity and ritual.
		<br /><br />
		With this in mind, the Wild Women Retreats ‘Summer Village’ is proudly born.
		<br /><br />
		Set in a beautiful, tranquil valley in West Dorset, close to the Jurassic Coast, Litton Cheney is
		in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Rich in prehistory and singing with spirit, the valley
		is at it’s most beautiful in the early summer.
		<br /><br />
		We will gather on Friday evening for beautiful food and a ceremonial opening before we set the scene
		for our weekend of celebration and connection. Each morning there will be yoga with
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/yogaJmoran" target="”_blank”">Juli Moran</a>, and song,
		sharing, intentional art and craft, ritual, meditation, laughter and magic. On Saturday evening
		we hope to gather together on the beach for ceremony and swimming (if the Sun and Sea allow, and
		swimming optional!) as the sun sets over the water. We will say goodbye on Sunday afternoon.
		<br /><br />
		Expect a joyful coming-together, with a focus on tribe and celebration. For those of you we know
		well and those who haven’t come to us before, see below for booking and further details. We can’t
		wait to see you there!
		<br /><br />
		This event will form a part of our exciting new yearly calendar, which will launch in 2024. It’s
		also going to include a deep-dive 5 day retreat for those who want more intensive work, and a year-course
		as well as the usual Glastonbury Winter Gathering (this year, over the weekend of 2/3 December 2023).
		We’ll keep you updated when all the specifics come through.
		<br /><br />
		Lastly, introducing our
		<a href="https://ko-fi.com/wildwomenretreats" target="”_blank”">Ko-fi</a>
		donations page! Without events, the funds to run our business are meagre and all the support we can
		get helps towards our administration and maintenance costs. We’d be very grateful for you to drop
		some pennies in or share this link around…
		<br /><br />
		Warmly, Natalie, Boann, and Rozi with Afric, Gemma, Juli & Shelley xxx
